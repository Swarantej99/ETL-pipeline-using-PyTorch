# ETL-pipeline-using-PyTorch

## Overview
This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** using **PyTorch**. The pipeline extracts raw data, processes it into a structured format, and loads it into a target destination for further analysis or model training.

## Features
- Extracts data from multiple sources (CSV, API, or database).
- Cleans and transforms data using PyTorch and Pandas.
- Loads processed data into a database or a file system.
- Supports automation and scalability for large datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **PyTorch** (for deep learning and transformations)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **SQL/NoSQL** (for data storage)
